The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, the `!important` declaration in the `.child` class has higher specificity than the declaration in `.parent .child`. However, unexpected behavior may arise if the `.child` class is nested inside another element also targeting `color`.  The !important rule might override intended styles unexpectedly in complex CSS structures.  Additionally, overusing `!important` makes CSS difficult to maintain and debug.
