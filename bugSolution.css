The solution avoids the use of `!important` entirely.  Specificity is managed through a more thoughtful class structure.  If specificity conflicts are necessary, consider using a more structured CSS methodology (like BEM or OOCSS) to create more maintainable code.

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green; /* Correctly overrides .child due to higher specificity */
}
```

This revised CSS avoids the `!important` declaration and achieves the desired result by managing specificity correctly.  The example showcases a safer and more maintainable approach to CSS development.
